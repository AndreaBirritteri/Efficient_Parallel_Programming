Insert-Sort Sequential vs Parallel in Java
## 2: Parallelization of Matrix Multiplication
Matrix Multiplication Sequential vs Parallel in Java
## 3: Prime Numbers
Sieve of Eratosthenes and Factorization of a large number. Sequential vs Parallel in Java
## 4: Parallel Radix with variable number of digits
Radix-Sort Sequential vs Parallel in Java
## 5: Finding the Convex Hull of a set of Points in a Plane, a Recursive Geometric Problem
